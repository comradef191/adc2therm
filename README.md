# ATTENTION: ACTUAL PCBS NOT YET TESTED
**MY PCBS HAVE NOT YET ARRIVIED, THUS I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO TEST THIS BOARD AND ITS STABILITY. FEEL FREE TO JOIN MY [DISCORD](https://discord.gg/cMK9gxetGT) FOR UPDATES; THIS NOTICE WILL BE REMOVED ONCE MY BOARDS ARRIVE AND I AM ABLE TO PERFORM SOME TESTING.**

# About
This is a simple PCB implementing the support circuitry necessery to properly connect a Thermistor to an ADC pin.

While originally intended to be used with the [SKR Pico](https://bttwiki.com/SKR%20Pico.html)'s `SERVO` port to add a port for a chamber thermistor, this board should have universal compatability.

It should be noted that this board uses 0603 SMD components, and as such hand-assembly may be more tricky to novices, though I have made sure to use the enlarged hand-assembly footprints.

MoQ cost of $2.74. This is enough for 30 PCBs, making for $0.09 in parts per board, before shipping, tax and PCB costs.

The cost for 75 boards, Including shipping, PCBs, and parts, is aprox $23.31 and Â£0.31 per board
